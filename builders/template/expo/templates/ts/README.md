## What is a Builder?

A **builder** in Loafy is a complete template containing the code and configuration for a specific framework, such as Next.js, Turborepo, or Expo. Builders provide ready-to-use project structures, helping you quickly scaffold applications with best practices and recommended setups for each framework.

## Why is this Split from the Main Package?

Package add-ons are published separately from the main `loafy` npm package to keep the bundle size minimal. This modular approach ensures you only install what you need. For example, if you only want to set up Next.js, you wonâ€™t get unnecessary dependencies like Expo or Turborepo, which would otherwise triple the bundle size.

This separation helps optimize resource usage, making your project setup lean and efficient.
